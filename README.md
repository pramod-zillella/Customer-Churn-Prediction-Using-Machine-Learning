# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict customer churn and optimize business retention strategies. Using an XGBoost model, we achieved a **63.37% cost reduction** in churn-related expenses, demonstrating potential savings of **$4.8M** for a business with 100,000 customers.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identified key predictors of customer churn.
- **Model Implementation**: Used **XGBoost** for robust non-linear modeling.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Calculated financial impact of model implementation.
- **Visualizations**: Included confusion matrices, AUC curves, and cost-reduction plots.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Cost without ML**: $75.71/customer
- **Cost with ML**: $27.74/customer
- **Cost Reduction**: $47.98/customer (~63.37%)
- **Potential Savings for 100,000 Customers**: $4.8M
